## INTRODUCTION  
In my capacity as an AI engineer and data scientist given the opportunity to investigate more about clinical trials, I’ve carefully examined the dataset that is given me. Several important topics are intended to be addressed by this investigation, which skillfully uses visuals to bolster findings.  

First, I’ll look at the total number of studies in the dataset, making sure to explicitly account for different research. The types of research that are here will next be discussed, with each type listed with its corresponding frequency in order of least to most frequent. I’ll also include the top 5 conditions found in the dataset along with their corresponding frequencies.  

I’ll also look for sponsors, paying special attention to non-pharmaceutical businesses. I’ll count the number of clinical studies that the top 10 sponsors outside the pharmaceutical industry have supported. Etc.
