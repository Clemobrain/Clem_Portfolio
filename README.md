### INTRODUCTION  
In my capacity as an AI engineer and data scientist given the opportunity to investigate more about clinical trials, I’ve carefully examined the dataset that is given me. Several important topics are intended to be addressed by this investigation, which skillfully uses visuals to bolster findings.  

First, I’ll look at the total number of studies in the dataset, making sure to explicitly account for different research. The types of research that are here will next be discussed, with each type listed with its corresponding frequency in order of least to most frequent. I’ll also include the top 5 conditions found in the dataset along with their corresponding frequencies.  

I’ll also look for sponsors, paying special attention to non-pharmaceutical businesses. I’ll count the number of clinical studies that the top 10 sponsors outside the pharmaceutical industry have supported. Etc.

### INTRODUCTION
As a database developer consultant for a hospital, I’m to create a complete database system that satisfies the needs of the customer. To effectively store and handle data on patients, medicaldoctor, medical records, appointments and departments, the hospital is creating a new database system. Particular client requirements were obtained at the first meeting in order to make sure that the database system meets the demands of both patients and healthcare practitioners. By making patient registration, appointment scheduling, medical record administration, and feedback gathering easier, this database system will expedite healthcare operations and enhance patient care.
In this task the first step I’ve decided to take is to prepare an ER proposed database design into 3NF, with the Entities, attributes and the relationships between them, taking into consideration the principles of database design which were thought in lecture. Below is the sketch of my proposed database tables and attributes.
